# Marco Polo

<i>“Oh I do listen.  Then I hear what I want”</i></br>
 <b>Kublai Khan</b>

Based on the real life traveller and merchant, Marco Polo by Netflix chronicles the time he spent at the court of Kublai Khan, the most powerful man in the world.  There are a few instances in which I doubted the historical accuracy (such as the episode in which they take down the wall of Xianyang with a trebuchet which was supposedly Marco’s idea). I feel that the story has been exaggerated for the sake of drama, and perhaps Marco Polo was not that influential in the Khans' life as the show suggests.  With that being said, the point isn’t whether this really happened, but what the underlying theme of power is all about. Overall the story is intriguing, with many subplots and lots of characters.  

The Mongol Empire is a fascinating part of medieval history.  I have always wondered how a force of 100,000 - 150,000 horse archers conquered almost all of Asia.  Clearly the warfare tactics and strategies used were different from whichever army the Mongols encountered, but that is a topic for another blog.  Having done some research on the Mongol Conquests, I have come to understand that the myth surrounding it has a one sided view.  Marco Polo in my opinion does a good job of showing different sides. 

 Kublai Khan is an interesting figure in history because he was the first non-Chinese to rule all of China, giving it the borders and capital that she has today.  He was considered too Chinese by his Mongol brethren, and too Mongol by his Chinese subjects.  Nevertheless he ruled over a vast empire, increasing the level of cultural dissemination across Eurasia, encouraging trade, and fostering religious tolerance.  The Mongol Khans’ to me were universal in that sense.  They had Han Chinese generals, Arab engineers, and non-mongol administrators just to name a few examples.  The show only lasted for 2 seasons so we don’t see how the Mongol Empire disintegrated and eventually collapsed which is a facinating story in itself.  

One character I particularly liked was 100 Eyes, a Taoist monk who gets captured, and blinded but ends up serving the Khan.  Kublai certainly has a way of enlisting talented men into his army whether through force or cunning.  100 Eyes teaches Kung Fu to Jingham, Kublai’s son.  Taoist philosophy has influenced me immensely and opened my mind to new ways of thinking and doing.  I don’t claim to be an expert but I know that there is a way to happiness and success that does not involve ego and violence.  

Lastly, I can relate to Marco Polo being an outsider in China.  I see myself as a businessman in Canada, a culture that is different to the one I was born in.  I have learned to survive through skills, practice and meditation, but there is still a long way to go.  Marco Polo’s great adventure in Asia is an inspiration for people of modest rank to rise up, to strive for something bigger than one self.
