# Warrior 

I recently started watching Warrior, a show based on Bruce Lee’s writings.  Being a big fan of all things Bruce Lee I was excited but did not know what to expect.  Knowing his previous work, I imagined there would be lots of fight scenes and action mixed with some drama.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story was well thought out, with unexpected plot twists, and characters who seem bad at first but become more sympathetic over time.  I found the pace of the show moved quickly without losing any dramatic effect.  The cinematography, music, and acting also make this show unique and compelling. 

Warrior bridges the cultural gap by showing several sides of the story.  Born in China, Ah Sahm  crosses the ocean to find his sister in San Francisco.  He quickly gets acquainted with the gangster life due to his exceptional martial arts skills, which we witness in the opening scenes of course. His style of martial arts resembles Wing Chun (the big giveaway is the dummy he practices on) but it soon becomes apparent that he can adapt to different situations as required.  There is clearly a homage to Bruce Lee with the mixed martial arts, they way Ah Sahm talks in short blunt sentences sprinkled with irony and sarcasm, and they way he taunts his opponents.  

What I find interesting is that even though he is very confident in himself, he has an underlying fatalism that counterpoints his business ventures.  Being a foreigner in San Francisco, he can speak english unlike most of the other asians which means he has more ‘opportunities’. He knows the Chinese are only seen as cheap labor, and not worthy to be called Americans.  In spite of all this, he still wants to make a name for himself through any means necessary.  This is what I identify with the most in this show.    

The other side is mainly represented by Bill who is an American officer assigned to police Chinatown. He is a middle aged man too fed up with the bureaucracy that makes decisions for him.  His anger comes through with his superiors, the foreign chinese workers that have crossed the “Salt” to find a better life, and the working class Irish.  We soon find out that he is in cahoots with all of them because he wants to keep the peace.  This was not clear in the beginning, but towards the final episode in season 1, we see all the pieces coming together.  Overall, he is a complex character and his connections with the different factions make for some unexpected twists.  

With lots of interesting characters, plenty of action sequences and political intrigue, this show has something for all who love martial arts and Bruce Lee in particular.  Before he passed away, he had come up with this idea and made a pitch to the studios in America but they were not interested in an Asian lead character in Hollywood.  More than 40 years later, his vision has finally become a reality.  I hope this show lasts for many seasons!.
