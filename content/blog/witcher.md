# The Witcher

<i>"Those linked by destiny will always find each other"</i>
 
I love the idea that a TV show, a video game, and a book all share the same story.  The cross-platform, multimedia element of such stories make for exciting
<b>experiences</b>,but this blog deals mainly with the Netflix series.  
 
Getting lost in a world has always excited me ever since I discovered books as a child.  Fantasy, science fiction, or just regular fiction, it didn’t matter.  If there was an interesting story, I was all in.  The Witcher has a world but we don’t see it the same way we might see Middle Earth.  The lore, the history, the culture reveal themselves more subtly over the course of the 8 episodes.  We are thrown right into the action, where it seems like multiple timelines are happening at the same time, and as we get to know the characters more, the world becomes more complete.  
 
Geralt of Rivia is the Witcher in question.  He is the quiet type, blunt, sarcastic, and a warrior in the truest sense (perhaps the lingering smell is the big giveaway).  He is clearly an outcast type, a mutant, enhanced by magic.  What is his higher purpose?  Apparently he is linked to a girl called Ciri and he must find her. Simple. But why?  I suspect the war between Cintra and Nilfgaard has something to do with it, but it seems like there is a deeper reason which we will see when season 2 comes out. 
 
The experience of being lost in this world known as the Continent are the side quests, and missions that make up the Bigger Picture, such as the 6th episode in which Geralt and other teams of adventurers seek out a dragon for the big payout. Though this didn’t really connect with the overarching plot, these mini-stories spice up the show.  There is humor, empathy, love, but also gore, war, and cruelty.  The Good vs Evil trope however is fairly obvious but the characters are complex enough to give a casual viewer something to connect with.  
 
The theme of destiny is of special interest as it ties all the pieces together.  It has a personal resonance for me because being an outsider myself, I struggled to find a connection with the different cultures I grew up around (Arabic, British, Canadian, Quebecois, Kashmiri).  I believe everyone needs to believe in something, whether that may be science, God, destiny, our selves, or just nature, it helps to have some sort of grounding in life to keep the despair at bay.  With all the struggles we see with Geralt, Ciri, or Yennefer the hunchback, we can see that an underlying destiny is at play.
