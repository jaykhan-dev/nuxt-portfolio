# UI/UX Design
The following designs were made with Adobe XD, and Illustrator.  My design philosophy for User Experience

### Scribendi China (2019)
This project lasted about 3 months.  It involved working with developers China to create a Chinese version for Scribendi's Editing and Proofreading service.  
We ended up making a blend of the two designs.  I created other assets like the intro video on the home page.  I learned a lot about UI/UX during this project 
it helped me get started in the field.
